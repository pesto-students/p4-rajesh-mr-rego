# What I've done to deploy my app

I'm going to explain pretty quickly what has been done.
<br>

1. Created a new repo on GitHub, called it Shorty. Just the branch 'main'
   <br>
2. Using AWS Amplify, made a new app, and called it Shorty again. Just coolly linked my 'shorty' repo to this 'shorty' app. Amplify did the rest, I didn't even have to compile and build.
   <br>
3. That's about it. Lotsa new things learnt. Please go to the link below, and check out my app.
